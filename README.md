# Quantum-Hunting
A fun game which is a reimagined version of quantum superposition.

Quantum Hunting is a playful exploration of one of the most fascinating principles in quantum physics: superposition, famously illustrated by Schrödinger’s cat experiment. In the quantum world, particles (and even systems) can exist in multiple states at once — just like Schrödinger’s hypothetical cat that is simultaneously alive and dead until observed.

In this game, the invisible buttons represent quantum uncertainty. You cannot know the “state” of a button (which symbol it holds) until you interact with it - mirroring how observation in quantum mechanics collapses a particle’s superposition into a definite state. Your task is to find the target symbol displayed above - essentially “measuring” the quantum system.

Every click is a measurement: sometimes you find the correct symbol (collapsing the superposition successfully), and sometimes you don’t - just like the probabilistic outcomes inherent in quantum systems. With each round, the target symbol changes, reflecting the dynamic and uncertain nature of the quantum world.

Through this interactive experience, Quantum Hunting gives a hands-on sense of superposition, probabilistic outcomes, and observation-dependent reality, all in a fun and engaging way.
